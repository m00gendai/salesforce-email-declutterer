## About 

Salesforce Case Email Printable View has a lot of unnecessary clutter and dumps everything in the same font size, weight and color, making it hard to extract necessary information.

Weberml's Case Printable View Declutterer removes unnecessar clutter and leaves only the case number (highlighted), the Email Body (highlighted) and Case History/Chatter, thus makin git easy to spot relevant information quickly.

The extension is a simple toggle on/off and will apply the decluttering on each new opened printable view as long as it is toggled on. To print the original case, simply toggle the Declutterer off.

Note that large email correspondence history (i.e. a lot of replies) cannot be broken down into individual chunks, as Salesforce simply injects everything into the email body.

## Installation

1. Clone repo
2. Enable Developer Mode in the Extension Settings of your Chromium Browser
